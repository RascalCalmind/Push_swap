# Push_swap

The analysis of algorithms is the determination of the computational complexity of algorithms, that is the amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute them. 

to do:
[0] remove the double list copy in store file.
[0] fix norm errors for too long functions and multiple functions in file.
[x] write a print-store function like printf so all the printing happens in the end instead of directly, which causes it to take longer at some points. (check sa with checker?)
[0] check if ft_itoa in stacks to buf free's the str
[0] check all functions for protection.
[0] optimize?
